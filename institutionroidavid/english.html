  </a><b><font size="+1">After many years of research, Suzanne
  Ha&iuml;k Vantoura has discovered the true musical value of the
  te'amim, i.e. the musical signs accompanying thebiblical text.
  She explains how and why this discovery is extraordinary.</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  Alliance - What brought you to your research on the musical meaning
  of the te'amim of the Biblical text ?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">S.Ha&iuml;k-Vantoura</font></b><font size="+1">:
  I had noticed them in the version of the Hebrew Bible</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">I used to read. I had also read in a musical
  encyclopaedia that these</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">signs of cantillation dated back to antiquity
  and that their real</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">musical meaning was lost. This triggered
  my curiosity. I had a vague</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">hope that this account might contain true
  and beautiful musical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">phrases hidden, which used to set off the
  Hebrew text.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Still the synagogue interpretation
  of this cantillation exists.</font></b>
  <dt><b><font size="+1">Aren't you satisfied with it?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S-H-V: The synagogue cantillation technique
  does not really constitute</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">music. It is composed of successive vocal
  formulae, without even a</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">single note corresponding to a pronounced
  stressed syllable, the other</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">notes constituting mere ornamentation. These
  vocal formulae only mark</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">stresses in the text without any musical
  logic. Moreover, these</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">formulae vary from one community to the other,
  from a book to another!</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">There is nothing in common between those
  formulas which are totally</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">misfit to the text and the te'amim once correctly
  interpreted and</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">established according to a determined order.
  Knowing that the musical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">meaning of the te'amim was lost, I could
  not feel satisfied with this</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">lack of music.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Could you explain what the te'amim
  are and where they are found?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S. H.V.-: The te'amim are signs found in
  the text of the Bible and</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">placed below or above the Hebrew words among
  the vowel-points and the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">other auxiliary signs. Here is a passage
  of the Decalogue : Exodus 20</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">in which you may find the te'amim marked
  in a different colour.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Here is the same passage with the te'amim
  but without all the other</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">signs</font>
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- How can we recognise the te'amim?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S.H.V.: Here are the te'amim in random order:
  19 supralinear and</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">sublinear signs. These signs appear in all
  the Hebrew texts of the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Bible.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- In the prose texts as well as in the
  psalms?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV.: That's correct. There are two sign
  systems : the prose system</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">and the psalm system. The prose system comprises
  8 sublinear signs.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">The psalm system only comprises 7, the six
  first being similar to</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">those of the prose system. The prose system
  comprises 8 supralinear</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">signs (the psalm system comprises much less)</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- How did you manage to identify the
  te'amim?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S.H.V. : I worked step by step. I first observed
  that the sublinear</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">signs were never absent from the text, while
  entire verses are totally</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">deprived of supralinear signs. I deduced
  from that fact that the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">sublinear signs had to be more important
  than the supralinear ones.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">For instance, here is a passage of Psalm
  122 where only sublinear</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">signs can be read. Still those signs constitute
  wonderful music (of</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">course I could not guess it at that time!)</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">This conclusion was crucial and greatly helped
  my research later. Then</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">I focused on the prose te'amim system only.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">That system comprises 8 sublinear signs as
  mentioned. I quickly</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">thought that it could correspond to the eight
  degrees of a musical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">scale, of a tonal scale. (The diatonic scale
  - C,D, E, etc,- is the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">oldest).</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">This hypothesis seemed to me to be supported
  by the nearly systematic</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">writing of a vertical sign at the end of
  each verse. This sign, I</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">thought, could work like an ending note,
  and could be used to indicate</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the main note of a tune... It seemed plausible,
  and I turned to be</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">right!</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Still, it's only one sign out of 8!</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S.H.V. : On the basis of this deduction and
  on the basis of the verbal</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">sentence, I tried to determine if certain
  sublinear signs would</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">reappear at the hemistich more often than
  others. I had in mind the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">two main degrees founding the tonality, the
  4th and the 5th, known</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">already for this function in the Antiquity,
  and upon which a</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">well-structured tonality is based while still
  being opened. I found</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">with surprise that there were two sublinear
  signs often mentioned at</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the hemistich which seemed to fulfil this
  function. Difficulties</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">really started when I tried to find out which
  was the 4th degree of</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the tonality and which one was the 5th. I
  had to work on hundreds of</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">verses. I finally identified the 4th degree
  sign and the 5th degree. I</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">had apparently identified three signs at
  that point, but nothing was</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">certain yet!</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- How did you find out the 5 other signs?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">S.H.V. : I had to write endless tables of
  concording sequences, trying</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">out an impressive number of verse-pieces
  ; comparing even the shapes</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">of signs</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">I could finally discover the meaning of the
  8 sublinear signs of the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">prose system.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">It took me more than six months of hard work!
  but it was not in vain!</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">bits and pieces of meaningful melodies emerged,
  sometimes</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">expressive... As a definite demonstration
  I managed to decipher the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">outline of the Song of the Red Sea which
  lasts approximately five</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">minutes. The 8 sublinear signs were identified
  : they are the 8 notes</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">of a scale. What was most interesting was
  the fact that the key-note</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">is a central note of the musical scale, which
  is common in Antiquity.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Why isn't there a sign under each syllable?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV : Because the musicians who created and
  wrote the text and the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">accompanying music were using an abbreviating
  system : any note</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">represented as a bottom sign is to be taken
  into account as long as</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">another bottom sign does not appear.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Let's consider again the beginning of the
  Song of the Red Sea : the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">dashes I placed here, set off when heard,
  the sounds prolonged over</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the syllables originally deprived of signs.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Yet I notice that in the Song of the
  Red Sea, the first note of the verse has no corresponding sign.
  Why is it so?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: because it is precisely the key-note
  which usually starts a</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">melody. Moreover this note, marked by the
  sign &quot; &quot;, always appears at</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the end of the preceding verse.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- But here is a supralinear sign above
  the first syllable of the</font></b>
  <dt><b><font size="+1">verse. What does it correspond to?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: The signs also symbolise the pitch of
  the notes. They do not</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">stand for fixed pitch (part of a given scale),
  but for the relative</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">pitch of the note in relationship to the
  current basic degree</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">represented by the preceding sublinear sign
  (like an ornamentation in</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">our present system of musical notation).
  I then discovered the second</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">principle of such a precise yet abbreviated
  system of notation : any</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">supralinear sign has an effect only over
  the syllable over which it is</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">written.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">As soon as the next syllable appears, the
  basic degree reappears,</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">while the sublinear corresponding sign does
  not necessarily reappear.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">On the basis of this definition, a supralinear
  sign can be set at the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">beginning of the verse. Still the degree
  it stands for is in relation</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">to the key-note which is implicit at the
  beginning of the verse.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">We may observe it in this example. Note that
  the exact position of a</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">supralinear sign at the beginning or at the
  end of a syllable is not</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">haphazard. On the contrary, it is highly
  important. Once the key</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">principle of the deciphering code is applied,
  the melody unveiled is</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">always more harmonious and expressive than
  if one had not taken into</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">account this delayed principle of notation.
  No one had ever before</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">taken into consideration this specificity
  of the notation.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">The readers interested in the details linked
  to the code-key should</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">refer to the book : &quot;Cl&eacute; de D&eacute;chiffrement
  des Signes</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Musicaux de la Bible&quot;</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- I understand. Still I wish to ask you
  : are there any accidentals?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: No, since accidentals did not appear
  in ancient notation systems.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">One must mention that the modes used in the
  Bible were not very</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">numerous . One of them in particular was
  characteristic of Middle</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Eastern music.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">It is like an E minor scale with a chromatic
  (augmented) interval</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">between the second and third degrees, and
  is still used in Israel</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">today.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- What about the rhythm?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV- The rhythm of the retrieved Biblical
  music hardly needs specific</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">marks. In prose, it is connected to the natural
  speech rhythm of</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">words, to the words carried by the melody,
  which is itself</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">rhythmically stressed by the very expressive
  accents of the words. The</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">length of the notes cannot be determined,
  and in that case it's</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">untranslatable. In psalmody it's the opposite
  case, because all the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">syllables have the same length, whether this
  length be one or several</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">notes long. This is also the principle of
  Eastern poetry.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A - Nevertheless, what was the system
  used to tell the cantors that one syllable rather than another
  was sung for several notes?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: You are right to mention this point,
  in particular since in the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">time of David and Solomon , no less than
  288 musicians-cantors would</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">sing the holy services. Of course the chief
  cantors would beat the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">time with the help of percussion, like our
  present conductors do. Yet</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">one must add that the chief cantors would
  also direct according to</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">David's musical gestures, indicating as such
  that one syllable, more</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">than another, was to be continued for several
  notes (other more</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">ancient gestural system existed at that time)</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">That gestural system was a living replica
  of the notational system</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">called for centuries &quot;according to David's
  hands&quot;.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">David and Solomon's times were the Golden
  Age of the music of the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Hebrews.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Do you think that this very specific
  technique may have lasted for centuries after the upheavals and
  hardships endured by the Hebrews?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: Yes, because the Levites were musicians
  from fathers to sons</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">until the very beginning of this era. Historical
  documents show that</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the Hebrews' sacred music was of great quality
  until the first century</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">of our era, although the number of musician
  Levites in the holy</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">services had greatly diminished (we find
  only 12 instrumentalists and</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">12 cantors in the holy services at the time
  of Jesus).</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- Then how do you explain the synagogal
  cantillation?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV : Since the ancestral cantilation of
  the psalms could not be</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">practised outside the Temple of Jerusalem,
  during the exile of Babylon</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">and after it, worshippers became accustomed
  to singing in synagogues</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">and to reading the holy texts according to
  standard formulae which</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">would be shortened or lengthened according
  to the length of verses.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">The te'amim disappeared progressively. They
  reappeared in the Biblical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">texts only at the 8th century. But the value
  of the signs seems to</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">have been lost completely by then. The Massorets
  of Tiberias and</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Babylon used them again in manuscripts, the
  political context of the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">9th century being more favourable. (see Music
  of the Bible Revealed</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">and Complementary Data).</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">Although it was quite allusive, Aaron Ben
  Asher, who was the last</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">master of the Biblical reading School of
  Tiberias, gave an</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">interpretation which imposed itself for lack
  of any other. It is still</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">being used today. Yet one must admit that
  it is only for texts written</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">in prose, since the te'amim of the psalms
  could never be interpreted</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">before. And one continues to hear psalms
  sung in synagogues with the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">help of repetitive formulae which I mentioned
  before. Moreover, in</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">most of the ritual books of synagogues, the
  signs of psalmody have</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">been taken out of the text for lack of understanding
  them, while the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">music of palms has such a powerful expression
  that the whole world</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">should sing it to join David's faith, whose
  message is universal.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- How long did you need to experiment
  on your music and on various texts before you were sure of the
  correctness of your discovery?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: I first applied it to over several hundred
  texts, but it was</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">mostly the work accomplished since I published
  my discovery in 1976,</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">which makes it indubitable. More than 5000
  verses are now &quot;musically</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">realised&quot; and can be performed with
  their music. My deciphering key</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">has never proved wrong. Here it is, with
  E as key-note.</font>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><b><font size="+1">A- After all these years of work and exciting
  discoveries, what is your conclusion?</font></b>
  <dt>&nbsp;
  <dt><font size="+1">SHV: For all the reasons I mentioned before,
  it is very sad that the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">interpretation of te'amim should be ignored,
  denied by the Synagogue</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">in general.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">On the other hand, I feel convinced of having
  relived the most</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">ancient musical notation ever known, which,
  apart from the musical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">value it conveys to our modern world, gives
  precision on the biblical</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">punctuation. The Biblical authors were poet-composers
  who created</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">themselves the music of their texts. Consequently,
  this music</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">perfectly fits the meaning of the words and
  enhances it. I was very</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">sad to think that all this heritage of humanity
  had been lost forever.</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">The situation is different now with Internet
  and thanks to the</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">interest you show in my discovery, this music
  will finally become</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">integrated in our human patrimony. My wish
  is that it will be so, for</font>
  <dt><font size="+1">the good and happiness of everyone until
  the end of Time !</font>
